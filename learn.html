        <h2>What is Addiction?</h2>
      <p>Addiction is when you have a need or urge to do something or use something, even if it causes harm..</p>
      <p>Addiction is defined as not having control over doing, taking or using something to the point where it could be harmful to you.</p>
      <p><b>Addiction is a chronic (lifelong) condition that involves compulsive seeking and taking of a substance or performing of an activity despite negative or harmful consequences. </b>Addiction can significantly impact your health, relationships and overall quality of life.</p>
      <p><b>Who is an Addiction?</b> <br>Most of us do not have to think twice about this question. We know! Our whole life and thinking was centered in drugs in one form or another the getting and using and finding ways and means to get more. We lived to use and used to live. Very simply, an addict is a man or woman whose life is controlled by drugs. We are people in the grip of a continuing and progressive illness whose ends are always the same: jails, institutions, and death.</p>

      <h2>Scenario of How Addiction is. </h2>
        <ul>
      <li>
         <em class="scenario">
          Liam was a football player with a bright future — until a knee injury put him on prescription painkillers. At first, the pills helped him sleep, move, and feel like himself. But when the prescription ended, the pain didn't — and neither did the urge. He started getting the pills from other sources, telling himself it was “just to cope.”
                  What Liam didn’t realize was that addiction had slowly taken root — not out of recklessness, but out of survival. He was trying to feel okay. Now he’s trying to get his life back.

       </em>
      </li>

          <li>
            <em class="scenario">
                    Amina checked her phone first thing in the morning and last thing at night. At school, during meals, even during conversations, she found herself scrolling — again and again. She’d delete apps, turn off notifications, even hide her phone. But the urge always crept back in.
      It wasn’t just a distraction anymore — it was a lifeline. Her world felt empty without it. Amina wasn’t lazy or weak. She was stuck in a digital loop, looking for connection and peace in a screen.

            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="scenario">
                    James knew the relationship wasn’t healthy. She lied, manipulated, and made him feel small. But every time he tried to leave, he came back. He craved her attention — even if it came with pain. It wasn’t just love. It felt like a need.
      Not all addictions involve substances. Sometimes, it’s people. Emotional addiction can trap someone in toxic cycles, confusing pain for passion and chaos for care.

    Addiction wears many faces. It’s not just about alcohol or drugs — it can hide in our habits, our screens, or even our relationships. 
    Each type affects the brain and emotions differently, but all can interfere with daily life and mental well-being.
  </p>
  <p>
    By understanding the different types of addiction, we break down stigma and create room for empathy, clarity, and healing.

       <h3>Substances Addiction</h3>
      <p>
        Substance addiction (also known as substance use disorder) is a chronic, relapsing condition where a person compulsively uses a drug or chemical substance despite harmful consequences. It affects the brain’s reward system, leading to a strong urge or craving to use the substance over and over — often at the cost of physical health, relationships, career, and personal freedom.
      </p>
      <h4>🚩 How It Starts</h4>
      <p>
        Addiction usually begins with voluntary use — for fun, relief, experimentation, or peer pressure. Over time, the brain adjusts to the substance, requiring more of it to feel the same effect (tolerance), and eventually making the user feel like they need the drug to function (dependence).

       <h3>🧬 Why Does Substance Addiction  Happens</h3>
       <p>Substance addiction doesn’t happen overnight — and it doesn’t mean someone is weak, lazy, or reckless. It’s often the result of a complex mix of biology, psychology, and life experience. Understanding these root causes helps remove the stigma and brings us closer to compassion and healing.</p>
      <div class="type-text1-sub">
<div class="type-text1-sub1">
   <ul>
        <li>
          Genetic Vulnerability 🧬
        </li>
        <p>Some people are born more at risk of addiction because of their genetic makeup. Studies show that up to 50% of the risk for addiction is inherited. If addiction runs in a family, it may mean the brain’s reward system is naturally more sensitive to substances — making it easier to become dependent.
          <br>
          For Instance:
          <b>“I didn’t know my father was addicted too. It just felt like I was wired differently — like my brain grabbed onto things harder.”</b>
        </p>

        <li> Environmental Triggers 🌍</li>
        <p>The world around us plays a huge role. Factors like: <br>

Growing up in a home with substance use  <br>

Living in poverty or high-stress environments <br>

Peer pressure or social norms <br>

Easy access to drugs or alcohol
can normalize substance use and make addiction more likely.
<br> For Instance:
<b>“Everyone around me drank or smoked. It felt normal. I didn’t know it was a problem — until it was.”</b>
</p>

<li> Trauma and Pain 💔</li>
<p>People with past trauma — such as abuse, neglect, or major loss — are significantly more likely to develop addiction. Substances can become a way to numb or avoid the pain that feels too overwhelming to face.

  <br> For Instance:
  <b>“It wasn’t about getting high — it was about forgetting what I’d been through. But eventually, the drugs became just another prison.”</b>
</p>
       </ul>
</div>
<div class="type-text1-sub1">
  <ul>
    <li>Mental Health Conditions 🧠</li>
    <p>Many people turn to substances to escape emotional pain, trauma, anxiety, or depression. This is known as self-medicating. But while substances might offer temporary relief, they often make the underlying problem worse — leading to a dangerous cycle.
      <br>
      For Instance:
      <b>“I wasn’t partying — I was trying not to feel. The pills helped me sleep at night… until they stopped working.”</b>
    </p>

    <li>Early Use (Especially in Teens) 🧒</li>
    <p>The earlier someone starts using substances, especially during teen years, the higher the risk of long-term addiction. The adolescent brain is still developing, and substances can disrupt emotional regulation, memory, and impulse control.
      <br>
      For Instance:
      <b>“I tried it at 15 just to fit in. Now I’m 28 and still trying to quit. It’s like it never let go.”
      </b>
    </p>
  </ul>

        <h3>Behavioral Addiction</h3>
        <p>Behavioral addiction is when a person becomes obsessed with and dependent on a behavior — like gambling, shopping, sex, or using social media — even when it causes harm to their health, relationships, or daily life.

Unlike substance addiction (which involves drugs or alcohol), behavioral addiction is tied to actions that trigger a similar “high” or reward in the brain — and people often feel unable to stop, even if they want to.</p>
<h4>It’s Not Just a “Bad Habit”</h4>
<p>A behavioral addiction goes beyond a simple bad habit or poor choice. It involves:
  <ul>
    <li>Craving the behavior constantly</li>
    <li>Loss of control (you try to stop but can’t)</li>
    <li>
Negative consequences (problems at school, work, home, health)</li>
    <li>

Negative consequences (problems at school, work, home, health)</li>
<li></li>

  </ul>
</p>
<h4>🔄 How It Works in the Brain</h4>
<p>Whenever we do something pleasurable — like eat, shop, scroll, or win a game — our brain releases dopamine, the “feel-good” chemical.

In behavioral addiction:
<ul>
  <li>  The brain starts chasing that dopamine rush again and again
</li>
  <li>
The behavior becomes a way to escape stress, pain, or boredom</li>
  <li>
Over time, it rewires the brain to seek that behavior like a survival need
</li>
</ul></p>
