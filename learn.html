        <h2>What is Addiction?</h2>
      <p>Addiction is when you have a need or urge to do something or use something, even if it causes harm..</p>
      <p>Addiction is defined as not having control over doing, taking or using something to the point where it could be harmful to you.</p>
      <p><b>Addiction is a chronic (lifelong) condition that involves compulsive seeking and taking of a substance or performing of an activity despite negative or harmful consequences. </b>Addiction can significantly impact your health, relationships and overall quality of life.</p>
      <p><b>Who is an Addiction?</b> <br>Most of us do not have to think twice about this question. We know! Our whole life and thinking was centered in drugs in one form or another the getting and using and finding ways and means to get more. We lived to use and used to live. Very simply, an addict is a man or woman whose life is controlled by drugs. We are people in the grip of a continuing and progressive illness whose ends are always the same: jails, institutions, and death.</p>

      <h2>Scenario of How Addiction is. </h2>
        <ul>
      <li>
         <em class="scenario">
          Liam was a football player with a bright future ‚Äî until a knee injury put him on prescription painkillers. At first, the pills helped him sleep, move, and feel like himself. But when the prescription ended, the pain didn't ‚Äî and neither did the urge. He started getting the pills from other sources, telling himself it was ‚Äújust to cope.‚Äù
                  What Liam didn‚Äôt realize was that addiction had slowly taken root ‚Äî not out of recklessness, but out of survival. He was trying to feel okay. Now he‚Äôs trying to get his life back.

          <li>
            <em class="scenario">
                    Amina checked her phone first thing in the morning and last thing at night. At school, during meals, even during conversations, she found herself scrolling ‚Äî again and again. She‚Äôd delete apps, turn off notifications, even hide her phone. But the urge always crept back in.
      It wasn‚Äôt just a distraction anymore ‚Äî it was a lifeline. Her world felt empty without it. Amina wasn‚Äôt lazy or weak. She was stuck in a digital loop, looking for connection and peace in a screen.

            </em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="scenario">
                    James knew the relationship wasn‚Äôt healthy. She lied, manipulated, and made him feel small. But every time he tried to leave, he came back. He craved her attention ‚Äî even if it came with pain. It wasn‚Äôt just love. It felt like a need.
      Not all addictions involve substances. Sometimes, it‚Äôs people. Emotional addiction can trap someone in toxic cycles, confusing pain for passion and chaos for care.
